## Install

Download from [here](https://github.com/xRealNeon/SoundKeys/releases). üíé 


## Build  

Building is a piece of cake as the app uses Electron. üç∞  
1. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Paste this in your command line and you're done!  

```
git clone https://github.com/xRealNeon/SoundKeys.git && cd SoundKeys && npm i && npm start
```

Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/xRealNeon/SoundKeys/issues). ‚úåÔ∏è  
The app hasn't been tested on Linux or OSX. Please provide [feedback](https://github.com/xRealNeon/SoundKeys/issues) if you did.

## RoadMap

Check the [Projects tab](https://github.com/xRealNeon/SoundKeys/projects) for the roadmap. üò∏

##### Login issues: (Only Facebook)üòø

As Electron opens each window in a seperate process, login callbacks aren't triggered properly.  
If the application stalls for you, reload the page and try to login again. (Sometimes twice)  
Reload is mapped to <kbd>F5</kbd>.
